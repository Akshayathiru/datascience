# Character Consistency Reasoning Engine

A premium, AI-powered reasoning system designed to analyze story narrative continuity by comparing character actions against their established backstory.

## Features

- **Advanced Narrative Analysis**: Parses long-form story text to extract behavioral patterns.
- **Backstory Cross-Referencing**: Isolates specific claims from character descriptions and validates them with story evidence.
- **Rule-Based Judgment**: Uses a strict reasoning logic where multiple strong contradictions trigger a "Contradicted" verdict.
- **Multidimensional Profile**: Evaluates character traits like Violence, Risk-taking, Trustworthiness, and Authority Respect.
- **Post-Analysis Queries**: A specialized chat-style box for asking "future questions" or seeking clarification on character motives and decision-making logic.
- **Human-Readable Explanations**: Provides detailed synthesis of *why* a character is judged consistent or otherwise.
- **Premium Research UI**: A clean, modern interface featuring glassmorphism, responsive design, and smooth animations.

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML5, CSS3 (Modern Flexbox/Grid), JavaScript (ES6+ Modules).
- **Styling**: Custom CSS design system with Inter, Outfit, and Playfair Display typography.
- **Dev Environment**: Vite for high-performance development and bundling.

## Reasoning Process

1. **Extraction**: Identifies character-specific events in the story.
2. **Behavioral Mapping**: Projects actions onto a trait matrix.
3. **Claim Validation**: Links backstory assertions to specific textual evidence.
4. **Synthesis**: Determines consistency based on the frequency and severity of behavioral drift.
